# Commit Workflow

## When to Commit

Commit after completing a **logical unit of work** — a cohesive piece of functionality that makes sense on its own. Examples:

- A new class, enemy, or ability is fully implemented
- A battle's enemy tuning passes validation
- A system (e.g., reactions, grid, combat) is added or meaningfully changed
- A bug fix is complete and verified
- A balance pass for a progression stage is locked
- A refactor is finished and the code still works
- Cursor rules or skills are added or updated

Do **not** wait for the user to ask. Do **not** commit half-finished work or mid-debugging states.

## Commit Message Format

Use the conventional commit style matching this repo:

```
<type>: <concise description of what changed and why>
```

Types:
- `feat` — new feature or capability
- `fix` — bug fix
- `balance` — stat/ability tuning or balance changes
- `refactor` — code restructuring with no behavior change
- `chore` — project config, rules, skills, tooling
- `docs` — documentation only

Keep the message to 1-2 sentences focused on the **why**, not a file list.

## Before Committing

1. Verify the change works (build succeeds, simulator runs, no obvious regressions)
2. Stage only the files related to the logical unit — don't bundle unrelated changes
3. Never commit files containing secrets (.env, credentials, keys)
